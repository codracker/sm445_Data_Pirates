## **1. Web Scraping**
             > Moneycontrol - @https://www.moneycontrol.com/
             > Rediff.com - @https://www.rediff.com/
             > Livemint - @https://www.livemint.com/
             > Screener.in - @https://www.screener.in/
      
   From these are the very webistes for the use.
   
**To do scrapping following libraries have been used:**

1.Beautiful Soup- Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files
   >pip install beautifulsoup
   
2.urllib- Collects several modules for working with URls- i.e. requests for opening and reading urls
   >pip install urllib

3.requests- Standard for making HTTP requests
  >pip install requests


## **2. Data Extraction**


## **3. UI-Streamlit** 

After the successful retrieval and processing of data, the product has to be displayed somewhere. So, the UI(user interface) is built upon the newly developed open-source app framework that is Streamlit[https://www.streamlit.io/]. Various components of streamlit have been taken in use to develop the required UI.

**Few of the components:**
    >st.sidebar
   >st.title
 >st.selectbox
 >st.subheader
 >st.button
 
 Supporting Libraries with Streamlit-
 
 1. Pandas
 >pip install pandas
 
 2. Numpy
 >pip install numpy
