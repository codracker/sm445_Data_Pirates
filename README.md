**Problem Statement**
The Corporate Action Robot is to be developed for retrieving accurate, and complete information on historical, current, and future expected corporate action in timely manner from free sources.Capability of crawling public web pages to retrieve information (Historical,current, future)
Ability of process information available in free text format like pdf, and MS word document 
Extract important information from retrieved pages/files on corporate action



[**RESOURCES**]



## **This project is being built on the following environment:**
    Processor: Intel(R)
    OS: Windows 7,8,10
    IDE: Anaconda Distributions(Jupyter Notebook)
    Language: Python3
    Web Browser: Google Chrome/Mozilla Firefox
    Additional Softwares: MS-Excel, Adobe PDF Reader, Notepad
    Python Language Libraries- Numpy, Pandas, beautifulsoup, urllib, requests
    IDE: Anaconda Distributions(Jupyter)     
    Frontend: Streamlit
    Backend: Spacy
    Database: MySql





## **Let us first crawl the workflow of the project:**
      > Web Scraping
      > Data Extraction
      > Text Analytics(PDF)
      > Deploying on UI(Streamlit)

##**ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM ** 
  
  
  
  
##**DATA FLOW**
  
## **1. Web Scraping**
      > Moneycontrol - @https://www.moneycontrol.com/
      > Rediff.com - @https://www.rediff.com/
      > Livemint - @https://www.livemint.com/
      > Screener.in - @https://www.screener.in/
      
   
**To do scrapping following libraries have been used:**

1.Beautiful Soup- Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files
   >pip install beautifulsoup
   
2.urllib- Collects several modules for working with URls- i.e. requests for opening and reading urls
   >pip install urllib

3.requests- Standard for making HTTP requests
  >pip install requests





## **ML MODEL **
   >NLP by Spacy using NER(Name Entity Recognition)with custom entities and annotations




[**Current Progress**]
Data source for corporate actions (CA) 
1.Is it configurable, if yes then what all is configurable?   **Yes**, it is configurable , we are parsing the html code of the website from which we are extracting tabular value , paragraphs(free text) and document links. 

2.Does it support any source, or only specific sources? Name them if specific: It supports multiple sources:-
 > www.moneycontrol.com
 > money.rediff.com/companies/news/Bonus
 > www.screener.in
 > mnacritique.mergersindia.com -->/search/bse?s=bse&category=M-and-A-Digest#

3.Does system support intelligent crawling to identify which all sources can provide data?: No



4.Type of data gathered {Tabular, structured, free text}:
   >Free Text
   >Tabular data (structured data which can be requestb according to the CA)
   >PDF's links of the company announcements 



5.Type of document supported {PDF, MS Word, MS Excel, html, etc.} : PDF,MS Word,html


6.Data collection is scheduled, real time, both: Data collection is on realtime , i.e, whenever the user requests to collect data it will execute and will always get the latest data


7.Technology / tool used: Beautifulsoip,urllib,requests



## **Data Extraction**

1.How is data extracted?: Web crawler outputs continous stream of data (Text strings) which is fed into NLP model.


2.What all datapoints systems can extract from free text?: NLP model: A built-in RNN is trained on Spacy library with custom entities.


3.Types of documents successfully processed : This neural net identifies pattern in data, as the position of entity present.System is able to extract key points related to considered corporate actions.


4.Links of various data that you are able to process, and to what extent (Complete / Partial):





5.Technology / tool used: We were successfully able to extract data from PDF (scanned/typed), using tessaract OCR.





## **Corporate Action scope covered.**
1.CA types supported- Dividends,
                    Could be extended to :Bonus, Splits,AGM/EGM(Board Meetings),Mergers & Acquisitions
                    
                    
2.Financial market supported: No


3.Historical / current: Historical data(extracted from the tabular data of different websites)
		-> Dividend
		->Rights
		->Board meetings
		->AGM/EGM
		->Bonus
		->Split
		->Quater results
		->Profit and loss
		->Balance sheet
		->Cash flows
		->Ratios
		->Share Holding patterns
	
   
   Current data
		Scrapping of Data
			->Free Text(News articles , summary of corporate announcements , Blogs)
			->PDF's links(Documents from company of CA)
		Processing of The data( Engine )
			

4.Workflow supported:
   i.New announcements of CA
   ii.Modifications
   iii.Cancellations
   iv.Market talks of CA before announcement
   
  
  
  
 5.Do system compliment / merge data from various sources to make it complete: No



## **Quality of data**
[]


## **Usability**
1.Type of application {Mobile, Web, Desktop}: Deployed on Web
2.Actions user can perform with this system: View information about company' corporate action as well as download the output.
3.GUI for application: Streamlit
4.Input to system and its corresponding output:  Company Selection by user and output regarding company's corporate action/announcements 
5.User overrides / customization possibilities: 
6.Technology / tool used: Streamlit Installation
>pip install streamlit

To run Streamlit
>Type Streamlit run [Filename]


After the successful retrieval and processing of data, the product has to be displayed somewhere. So, the UI(user interface) is built upon the newly developed open-source app framework that is Streamlit[https://www.streamlit.io/]. Various components of streamlit have been taken in use to develop the required UI.

## **Few of the components are:**
    > st.sidebar
    > st.title
    > st.selectbox
    > st.subheader
    > st.button
      
    
 Supporting Libraries with Streamlit-
 
 1. Pandas
 >pip install pandas
 
 2. Numpy
 >pip install numpy



##**Data Management**
1.What is captured by system {Raw input data, Output of extraction tool, Final output}: 
 >Raw input data: Data is  web-scraped
 >Output of extraction tool: Data extracted by SpaCy model
 >Final Output: Structured Information displayed on UI
 
2.How data us stored/Data design? 
  > Data is stored in Mysql Database
  > Data Design
  >Technology / tool used: 



##**Any other features / specialty of system that make it unique**
