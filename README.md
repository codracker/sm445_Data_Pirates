## **Let us first crawl the workflow of the project:**
      > Web Scraping
      > Data Extraction
      > Text Analytics(PDF)
      > Deploying on UI(Streamlit)
     
     
     
  
## **1. Web Scraping**
      > Moneycontrol - @https://www.moneycontrol.com/
      > Rediff.com - @https://www.rediff.com/
      > Livemint - @https://www.livemint.com/
      > Screener.in - @https://www.screener.in/
      
   From these are the very webistes for the use.
   
**To do scrapping following libraries have been used:**

1.Beautiful Soup- Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files
   >pip install beautifulsoup
   
2.urllib- Collects several modules for working with URls- i.e. requests for opening and reading urls
   >pip install urllib

3.requests- Standard for making HTTP requests
  >pip install requests


## **2. Data Extraction**


## **3. User Interface** 

Streamlit Installation
>pip install streamlit

To run Streamlit
>Type Streamlit run [Filename]


After the successful retrieval and processing of data, the product has to be displayed somewhere. So, the UI(user interface) is built upon the newly developed open-source app framework that is Streamlit[https://www.streamlit.io/]. Various components of streamlit have been taken in use to develop the required UI.

## **Few of the components are:**
    > st.sidebar
    > st.title
    > st.selectbox
    > st.subheader
    > st.button
      
    
 Supporting Libraries with Streamlit-
 
 1. Pandas
 >pip install pandas
 
 2. Numpy
 >pip install numpy
